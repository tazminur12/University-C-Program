# C Programming Projects

Welcome to my collection of C programming projects! This repository includes various projects developed as part of my university coursework and personal projects. These projects demonstrate my skills in C programming, including data structures, algorithms, and system-level programming.

## Projects

### 1. **Library Management System**
   A console-based application to manage books and users in a library. Features include:
   - Adding, removing, and searching for books.
   - Managing user accounts for borrowing and returning books.
   - Displaying book availability.

### 2. **Payroll Management System**
   A payroll system that handles employee data and payroll calculations. Features include:
   - Storing employee information (name, ID, position, salary).
   - Calculating monthly wages and tax deductions.
   - Generating salary reports.

### 3. **Employee Management System**
   A simple system to manage employee records. It includes:
   - Adding, updating, and deleting employee records.
   - Viewing all employee records.
   - Searching for employees by name or ID.

### 4. **Other C Code**
   This includes various C programs related to:
   - Data structures (Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues).
   - Algorithm implementations (sorting, searching).
   - Miscellaneous small projects.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepositoryname.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd yourrepositoryname
    ```

3. Compile the C files using a C compiler:
    ```bash
    gcc filename.c -o outputname
    ```

4. Run the program:
    ```bash
    ./outputname
    ```

## File Structure
